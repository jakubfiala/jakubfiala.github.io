			My name is Jakub Fiala. I was born in the peculiar post-utopian town of Partizánske, Slovakia, and went on to play classical guitar.
			At the age of 16 I moved to Bratislava (the capital) and played bebop, free jazz and improvised music.
			I also produced ambient music and played in rock bands.
			I journeyed to Goldsmiths in London to study music production, but ended up on a music computing course by accident.
			I found myself composing generative, indeterminate soundscapes and building interactive software and installations.
			I discovered javascript and began building rich interactive web applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since then I've been interested in allowing communities of ordinary people to create 'leak art', one that surpasses its own frame;
			and creating for these communities experiences of <i>peace</i> or <i>awe.</i> I'm aiming at this by creating sound art/design, collaboration platforms, and refined artistic products in space.
			I also like trees, trains and early mornings ~

			<h3>Theydon Boys</h3>
			<h4>Back in early 2013, I have conceived a soulful electronic music project under the following brief:</h4>
			<p>
				Them theydon boys, lucky to have survived their first day at middle school, ridiculously bad at football and mediocre at Call of Duty. When they started supporting Chelsea, Mourinho was fired. They associate numbers with colours and get excited over ancient Greek poetry. If only they hadn't gone extinct in the Great Fire of 1666, you would've still met a couple of them on Stansted's benches trying to get some sleep, reading their copies of Neverwhere, and talking about their homeland, far away to the west, nested among the hilltops of Wales. Who has the money for train tickets these days, anyway.
			</p>
			<p>
				Named after a mispronounced tube stop in East London, Theydon Boys is an electronic musician with unstoppable hatred for 80's synths and a severe samples deficiency. The desired product is music for the redundant generation.
			</p>

			<h3>Sound design & composition projects</h3>
			<p>
				My composition and sound design practice encompasses mainly two areas: first of all, I compose fixed pieces for media, performances and art installations. I'm also interested in the field of generative composition – i.e. creating pieces that are different everytime one listens to them, and evolve based on a ruleset rather than my mechanical input.
			</p>
			<h4>A betolakodó</h4>
			<p>
				/w David Somló for an Andaxínház theatre production in Budapest // recording, improvised performance, sound design (not in video)
			</p>

			<h4>Map series » a performance on colonialism</h4>
			<p>
				field recording // sound design // for performance and installation by Berlin-based playwright and performance artist Ana Mendes<br>
				commisioned by festival Chromoos, Gallery Dasmoosdorf<br>
				to premiere on May 23 2014<br>
				<img src="images/map.jpg" width="100%" style="position:relative; left: 50px;">
			</p>

			<h4>Das ist mein Gott | This is my God</h4>
			<p>
				Sound design for <a href="http://anamendes.com/video/this-is-my-god/">a set of short films</a> by Ana Mendes
			</p>

			<h4>Growing Things</h4>
			<p>
				(in development) composition for electric guitar & generative system // based on genetic algorithms and Lindenmayer systems<br>
				to premiere in late April 2014 at Goldsmiths College
			</p>

			<h4>Ghosts</h4>
			<p>
				sound design, reactive composition // ongoing piece based on the disappearance of Amelia Earhart in the late 1930s. Exploring the relationship between events and interpretations via a reactive audio analysis system // intended as a sound installation
			</p>

			<h4>Waves</h4>
			<p>
				generative composition, electronic // my first year 2 composition at Goldsmiths // post-serialist piece attempting to juxtapose the ideas of pitch equality and invariant transformation to natural mechanisms of reverberation and material response // static recorded piece
			</p>

			<h4>Story Culture</h4>
			<p>
				I compose and produce royalty-free music for <a href="http://storyculture.co.uk/">this exciting creative film agency.</a>

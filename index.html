		<div id="_bio">
			<p>I am a London-based digital artist, musician and programmer, currently studying Music Computing at <a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/ug/bmus-bsc-music-computing/">Goldsmiths, University of London</a>. Having grown up in the peculiar post-industrial town of Partizánske in Slovakia, and later spent several years studying for the International Baccalaureate in the decadence and chaos of Bratislava, I am now striving to build upon these experiences and develop my artistic signature in the United Kingdom. My work includes musical compositions, sound design, audiovisual artworks, live performances and computer applications &#9654</p>
			<p>Despite having studied classical guitar and, later on, jazz and free improvisation, my main musical interest is electronic music and computer art in general. I am mostly interested in making pieces that are free of framework limitations set by the traditional notion of exposition in a gallery or a concert. Furthermore, I have been exploring the collective nature of human society as a tool for creation of art. This leads to the vision of open &amp organic art – public, evolving, indeterminate and self-aware &#9654</p>

			<h3>Theydon Boys</h3><br>
				<h4>Back in early 2013, I have conceived a soulful electronic music project under the following brief:</h4>
			<p>
				Them theydon boys, lucky to have survived their first day at middle school, ridiculously bad at football and mediocre at Call of Duty. When they started supporting Chelsea, Mourinho was fired. They associate numbers with colours and get excited over ancient Greek poetry. If only they hadn't gone extinct in the Great Fire of 1666, you would've still met a couple of them on Stansted's benches trying to get some sleep, reading their copies of Neverwhere, and talking about their homeland, far away to the west, nested among the hilltops of Wales. Who has the money for train tickets these days, anyway.
			</p>
			<p>
				Named after a mispronounced tube stop in East London, Theydon Boys is an electronic musician with unstoppable hatred for 80's synths and a severe samples deficiency. The desired product is music for the redundant generation.

			<h3>Sound design & composition projects</h3><br>
			<p>
				My composition and sound design practice encompasses mainly two areas: first of all, I compose fixed pieces for media, performances and art installations. I'm also interested in the field of generative composition – i.e. creating pieces that are different everytime one listens to them, and evolve based on a ruleset rather than my mechanical input.

			<h3>Software projects</h3><br>
			<h4>1WALL (beta)</h4>
			<p>
				Combining three of my greatest passions – public art, community and installation, I have built a space on the Internet where people can express themselves publicly and contextually, collaborating together on a giant Bayeux tapestry-style drawing. Currently running in beta, 1WALL is the representation of my ideas of organic art, and my first public retirement into the position of a developer, architect of an empty space that is only filled with meaning by its audience. <a href="http://igor.gold.ac.uk/~mu201jf/">Draw and explore here.</a>
			</p>
			<br><br><br><br>
			<h4>minimaltune</h4>
			<p>
				In my 1st year at Goldsmiths, I made a lightweight and precise guitar tuner app for OSX. Built in <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>.<br>
				Download <i>minimaltune.app</i> on <a href="https://github.com/jakubfiala/minimaltune">Github</a>.
			</p>
			<br><br><br><br>
			<h4>Web design & development</h4>
			<p>
				I ocassionally work as a freelance web designer/developer.<br>
				Successful projects include:<br><br>
				<a href="http://esterwiesner.com" style="font-size:">esterwiesner.com</a><br>
				Upcoming star of Slovak jazz, currently pursuing vocal studies at Berklee College of Music<br><br>

			<h3>Installations</h3>
			<p>
				Being only a recent interest of mine, installation art is something I am planning on developing in the future. Having collaborated on a few installations at goldsmiths, I am now in the process of devising a sound installation in a public marketplace in Bratislava // more info soon

			<p>I am a London-based artist, musician and programmer, currently studying Music Computing at Goldsmiths, University of London. Having grown up in the peculiar post-industrial town of Partizánske in Slovakia, and later spent several years studying for the International Baccalaureate in the decadence and chaos of Bratislava, I am now striving to build upon these experiences and develop my artistic signature in the United Kingdom. My work includes musical compositions, audiovisual installations, live performances and computer applications &#9654</p>
			<p>Despite being trained in classical guitar and, later on, jazz and free improvisation, my main musical interest is electronic music and computer art in general. I am mostly interested in making pieces that are free of framework limitations set by the traditional notion of exposition in a gallery or a concert. Furthermore, I have been exploring the collective nature of human society as a tool for creation of art. This leads to the vision of open &amp organic art – public, evolving, indeterminate and self-aware &#9654</p>

			<h3>Theydon Boys</h3>
			<p>
				Them theydon boys, lucky to have survived their first day at middle school, ridiculously bad at football and mediocre at Call of Duty. When they started supporting Chelsea, Mourinho was fired. They associate numbers with colours and get excited over ancient Greek poetry. If only they hadn't gone extinct in the Great Fire of 1666, you would've still met a couple of them on Stansted's benches trying to get some sleep, reading their copies of Neverwhere, and talking bullshit about their homeland, far away to the west, nested among the hilltops of Wales. Who has the money for train tickets these days, anyway.
			</p>
			<p>
				Named after a mispronounced tube stop in East London, Theydon Boys is an electronic musician with unstoppable hatred for 80's synths and a severe samples deficiency. The desired product is music for the redundant generation.

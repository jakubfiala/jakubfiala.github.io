I specialise in audiovisual programming on the Web. I write mainly *modern JavaScript*, but also *Python, SASS, C++, Swift* and *Rust*. My past clients include [XL Recordings](http://xlrecordings.com/), [KnowledgeRocks](https://knowledgerocks.com/), [Synervoz](https://www.linkedin.com/company/synervoz-communications-inc.) and [greyworld](http://greyworld.org/).

## The Weird Stuff

I've made quite a few (often tragically unfinished) code abominations that I just feel need to exist.
Like [HorribleCoffee](https://fiala.uk/HorribleCoffee), my [early crystallic Blender models](https://fiala.uk/forms),
and the first two scenes of a WebGL/WebAudio series called [Worlds](https://fiala.uk/worlds/w1) ([scene 2](https://fiala.uk/worlds/w2) here, chrome/firefox only, webcam required).
Also there's [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deprocházkifikátor/fibofalicildmhddbklnedjfciffbfoo) that replaces the name of one unpopular Slovak politician with more fitting (non-profane) names.
